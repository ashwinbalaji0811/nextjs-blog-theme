This is an example post. There's another one [here](/posts/example-post).

The history of fourfold negation, the Catuskoti (Sanskrit), is evident in the logico-epistemological tradition of India, given the categorical nomenclature Indian logic in Western discourse. Subsumed within the auspice of Indian logic, 'Buddhist logic' has been particularly focused in its employment of the fourfold negation, as evidenced by the traditions of Nagarjuna and the Madhyamaka, particularly the school of Madhyamaka given the retroactive nomenclature of Prasangika by the Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition. Though tetralemma was also used as a form inquiry rather than logic in the nasadiya sukta of rigveda (creation hymm) though seems to be rarely used as a tool of logic before buddhism[1]

A variant of the tetralemma is used in the Ancient Greek philosophical schools of Democritus[2] and Pyrrhonism. Pyrrho includes it in his summary of his teachings, and Sextus Empiricus includes it among the Pyrrhonist Maxims.
